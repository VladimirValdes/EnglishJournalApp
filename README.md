## Overview

![screenshot](src/assets/images/englishJournal.png)

This app was built with the purpose to solve the following problem I am learning English by myself and I needed to save my progress at the beginning I started to save my notes in a notebook, but I thought why not build an app where I can be able to save my English progress and I created English Journal is a web app where you can save verbs, phrasal verbs, adjectives, connectors and prepositions. I built this app using MEAN stack.

### What you can do with English Journal?
  - You can save, update, and delete your verbs, phrasal verbs, adjectives, connectors and prepositions.
  - You can create reports.
  - You can filter by verbs, phrasal verbs, adjectives, connectors and prepositions.
  - You can search by verbs, phrasal verbs, adjectives, connectors and prepositions.


### What did I learn building this app?
I learned a lot of things developing this app, for instance I learned how to use interceptors in angular and their different  cases of use, I learned how to use chart.js with angular. Short, long story, I learn so much creating this project.
